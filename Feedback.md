Great work! All your tests passed, and your implementations lined up perfectly with what we had in mind. I thought your implementation of `printCatNames` was clever, defining an `abstract` `isCat` method in the `Animal` superclass. Another option would have been to just check if `species.equals("cat")`. Overall, well done!
